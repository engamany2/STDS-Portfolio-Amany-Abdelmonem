# AdventureWorks Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on performing **data analysis** on the AdventureWorks dataset using **SQL** and **Excel**.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to clean, analyze, and visualize business data to gain insights into sales performance, profitability, and product trends.

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing (SQL)
Data preprocessing was done using **SQL Server**, where I:
- Checked for **null values** and replaced them appropriately.  
- Handled **duplicates** using SQL scripts.  
- Cleaned and standardized categorical values (e.g., replacing `NA` with `UNKNOWN`).  
- Verified data consistency across multiple tables (Products, Regions, Resellers, Salespersons, and Targets) using Dynamic SQL.

## 📈 Dashboard (Excel)
After cleaning the data, I built an interactive **Excel dashboard** that includes:
- **modeling** to connect related tables.
- **Measures** to calculate Profits and Target Achievement Percentage
- **Cards** showing:
  - Total Sales  
  - Total Profit  
  - Total Quantity Sold  
  - Average Sales  
- **Charts** visualizing:
  - Sales vs. Cost over time  
  - Comparison between Categories and Subcategories  
  - Other performance-related insights
  - And More

The dashboard provides a clear visual summary of key metrics and business performance.
