 **🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project**

 
This project focuses on performing an in-depth data analysis of pizza sales 🍕 to extract Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), understand customer behavior, identify temporal patterns (daily, hourly, and monthly), and support strategic business decisions.





**📊 Project Overview**

What did this project focus on? 👇

The primary goal of this project was to clean, analyze, and visualize pizza sales data to understand:

  - Overall revenue and order volume.

  - Which pizza categories and sizes are the best and worst sellers.

  - The peak timings for sales throughout the day, week, and month.

  - Key Insights to help improve inventory management and marketing strategies.

**⚙️ Data Preprocessing Stage**
In this stage, the data was prepared to be suitable for analysis, which involved two crucial steps:

1. Extracting Temporal Dimensions ⏰
   
Process: We successfully extracted the Day Name and Month Name columns from the original Order Date column.

Importance: This allowed us to perform deep analysis of seasonal and behavioral patterns daily and monthly, which is clearly demonstrated in charts like Total Orders by Month and Total Orders by Day Name.

2. Modifying Data Types 🧬
   
Process: Adjustments were made to the Data Types of various columns to ensure accurate calculations and correct categorical classification.

Importance: This step ensured that numerical columns (like quantities and prices) were stored as numbers, and temporal columns were stored as dates, resulting in accurate calculations and visualizations.

**📈 Interactive Dashboard**

After data preparation, an interactive Dashboard was created to display the results in an accessible and understandable format. The Dashboard includes:

1. Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Cards 💳
 
Five essential measures were calculated and displayed in cards to provide a quick summary of sales performance:

  - Total Revenue: The total earnings (e.g., $817.9K).

  - Avg Orders Value: The average value of a single order.

  - Avg Pizza per order: The average number of pizzas per order.

  - Total Orders: The total number of orders placed.

  - Total Pizza Sold: The total number of pizza slices/units sold.

2. Analytical Charts and Visuals 📊

These visuals illustrate the distributions and patterns:

  - Revenue Distribution by Category and Size: (Doughnut Charts) Highlight the top-performing category (Classic) and size (Large) contributing to revenue.

 - Top 5 and Bottom 5 Pizzas: (Bar Charts) Identify high-performing products that require focus and underperforming products that need review or potential removal.

  - Temporal Patterns (Time Series):

    - Total Orders by Month/Day Name/Hour: Show the peak months, days, and hours for orders, which is vital for efficient shift and inventory management.

  - Revenue vs. Target Comparison: (Gauge Chart) Measures progress towards the set revenue target (e.g., $817.86K vs. the Target).

**🧠 Key Insights**

This analysis helped us uncover critical findings such as:

  - Dominance of Large and Classic: Large sized pizzas and the Classic category are the main revenue drivers, and their supply chain must be prioritized.

  - Individual Product Champion: The Thai Chicken Pizza was identified as the single top-earning product, despite fierce competition.

  - Peak Time Identification: (Based on the Charts) Days like Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and hours around 5 PM to 6 PM are peak times that demand maximum operational readiness.
