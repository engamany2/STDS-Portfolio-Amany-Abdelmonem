# Reflection on Excel Dashboard Task

## 1. What I Learned
Through this project, I enhanced my skills in several key areas of Excel:
- **Data Cleaning:** I learned how to handle missing values and standardize text columns (e.g., cleaning the 'Location' and 'Revenue' columns) to ensure accuracy before analysis.
- **Pivot Tables:** I gained a deeper understanding of using Pivot Tables to aggregate large datasets and extract meaningful insights.
- **Dashboard Design:** I learned how to create an interactive dashboard using Slicers to filter data dynamically, making the visualization user-friendly.

## 2. What Was Challenging
- **Chart Selection:** Deciding which chart type best represents specific data points (e.g., choosing between a Bar Chart or a Pie Chart for 'Job Status') took some trial and error to ensure clarity.

## 3. What I Improved
- **Visualization Esthetics:** Compared to my previous attempts, I focused more on the color scheme and layout consistency to give the dashboard a professional look.
- **Efficiency:** I improved my workflow by using Excel shortcuts and formulas to speed up the data preparation process.
